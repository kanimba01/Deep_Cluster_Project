# Deep Cluster Project

This project implements deep clustering models using PyTorch. It includes two types of clustering:
1. **Single Modality Deep Clustering**: Processes a single modality visual type.
2. **Cross Modality Deep Clustering**: Processes visual and audio types of input data simultaneously.
